# Notes on Firefox

To enable Firefox' internal fingerprinting countermeasures, enter `about:config` into your address bar, confirm the security check and search for `privacy.resistFingerprinting`. Set this option to true.

(Keep in mind that fingerprinting protections can break certain websites which rely on the features the fingerprinting protection takes away, so this might be a knob to turn if you encounter problems with e.g. using media devices like microphones on certain websites.)
