# Nothing Private
This project is a proof of concept that anyone can identify and track you, even if you are using **Private Browsing** or **Icognito Mode** in your web browser. Many people thinks that they can hide their identity if they are using private browsing or icongnito, This project will prove them they are wrong.

## Hey! How?
Hope you are surprised! :smile:. Yes the website can remember your name even if you had visited it via the **Private browsing** or **Icognito Mode**. Yes nothing is private in this world anymore!. This is what the big companies are doing with your identity. You think that going private mode will wipe out all the traces. **Absolutely Not!**. Acually, using the private browsing or icognito mode will just help you to clear your browsing history.
