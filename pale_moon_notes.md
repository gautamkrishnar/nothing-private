## Hey, I have Pale Moon 28.5.2+! How can you still track me?
Because Pale Moon still allows fingerprinting by default, however you can turn it off with a little dwelling in your browser configuration.

### Step 1.
In browser address bar, type `about:config` and press enter, then press "I promise to be careful"

### Step 2.
In configuration page search bar, search for `poisondata` and look for option `canvas.poisondata`

### Step 3.
Right-click on it and from menu choose `Toggle` option

`canvas.poisondata` should change its status from `default` to `modified` and value to `true`
