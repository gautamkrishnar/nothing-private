# Nothing Private
This project is a proof of concept that anyone can identify and track you, even if you are using **Private Browsing** or **Icognito Mode** in your web browser. Many people thinks that they can hide their identity if they are using private browsing or icongnito, This project will prove them they are wrong.

## Hey! How?
Hope you are surprised! :smile:. Yes the website can remember your name even if you had visited it via the **Private browsing** or **Icognito Mode**. Yes nothing is private in this world anymore!.
