## Hey, I have Waterfox 56.2.11+! How can you still track me?
Because Waterfox still allows fingerprinting by default, however you can turn it off with a little dwelling in your browser configuration.

### Step 1.
In browser address bar, type `about:config` and press enter, then press "I accept the risk"

### Step 2.
In configuration page search bar, search for `fingerprinting` and look for option `privacy.resistFingerprinting`

### Step 3.
Right-click on it and from menu choose `Toggle` option

`privacy.resistFingerprinting` should change its status from `default` to `modified` and value to `true`
