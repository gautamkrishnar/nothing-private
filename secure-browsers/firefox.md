# Notes on Firefox

To fool https://nothingprivate.ml, it is sufficient to use one of

  * [CanvasBlocker](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/canvasblocker/)
  * [Random User-Agent](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/random_user_agent/) (manually trigger a change in the User Agent if you don't want to wait for a while)

To get an even more private browsing experience, a couple of more addons are useful:

  * [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/)
  * [First Party Isolation](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/first-party-isolation/)
  * [Cookie AutoDelete](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-autodelete/)
  * [Decentraleyes](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/decentraleyes/)

Furthermore, it is useful to enable strict tracking protection in the Firefox-preferences.
